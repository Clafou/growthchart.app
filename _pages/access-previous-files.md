# How to access your previous files

If you got a new iPhone or iPad and you were using external file storage, you won't see your children in the "Recent files" section that you had on your previous device.

But your data isn't gone! It is still in your files. All you need to do is to reopen these files on your new device.

## Instructions

Open the Files app. Search for your file (by default they are the name of your child followed by a .growth file extension -- for example Theo.growth) and tap on it.

The child's data is now listed in the app and you can open it to edit measurements, which will be synced to other users and devices via the cloud file.

Alternatively, open Growth, tap on the folder button at the top, locate the file and choose it. This is the same as opening it from the Files app.
