# Fixed

## Version 2.0.3

* The setting defaulted to the wrong mode for preterm babies (it should default to "From: Due date" but instead was "From: birth") and some settings did not stick, requiring to reapply them each time when opening charts. This is fixed in version 2.0.4.

## Version 2.0.1

* A bug on iPad (but not on iPhone) makes it impossible to create a profile if you have selected external storage. This is fixed in version 2.0.2.

## Version 2.0

* Crash on iOS 13 – When you open a child on iOS 13, Growth+ immediately shuts down. This is fixed in version 2.0.1.
