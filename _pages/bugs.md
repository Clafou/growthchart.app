# Known Bugs

Version 2.0.5 is now available. There is a crash affecting some users when opening the charts for a child. This will be fixed soon. In the meantime you can do the following to avoid the crash:
* Tap on a child that does not trigger the crash (or create a new profile then tap on that child)
* Tap on the wheel icon at the top
* Tap on List Options
* Tap on Show and change it to Date. The crash no longer occurs while this setting is active.

## Is something wrong?

If you are experiencing issues with the app, please tap on the ⓘ button in the top left corner, then on 'Send Feedback' and describe the issue in your email. I will then investigate and respond as soon as I can. Sorry for the inconvience and thank you for your understanding – Seb

# Fixed

## Version 2.0.4

A glitch causes the age display to be incorrect (wrong number of days). This is fixed in version 2.0.5.

## Version 2.0.3

* The setting defaulted to the wrong mode for preterm babies (it should default to "From: Due date" but instead was "From: birth") and some settings did not stick, requiring to reapply them each time when opening charts. This is fixed in version 2.0.4.

## Version 2.0.1

* A bug on iPad (but not on iPhone) makes it impossible to create a profile if you have selected external storage. This is fixed in version 2.0.2.

## Version 2.0

* Crash on iOS 13 – When you open a child on iOS 13, Growth+ immediately shuts down. This is fixed in version 2.0.1.
