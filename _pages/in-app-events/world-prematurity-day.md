# World Prematurity Day – November 17

Growth joins the campaign to raise awareness about prematurity.

The app includes the [Fenton 2013 growth charts](https://www.ucalgary.ca/resource/preterm-growth-chart/preterm-growth-chart) for preterm babies.

And, when you input a preterm due date in a child's profile, the app will activate corrected age tracking, giving you more useful results and percentiles when using the other growth charts (WHO and CDC). This corresponds to the "From Due Date" setting, as opposed to "From Birth".
