# World Prematurity Day – November 17

Growth joins the campaign to raise awareness about prematurity.

Purple is used on November 17 to raise awareness about prematurity (for example public buildings are lit up in purple). An alternate purple app icon in purple is available for the event by tapping on the World Prematurity Day event on the [Growth App Store page](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/growth-baby-child-charts/id446639811?uo=4).

The app is ideal for the parents and carers of premature babies. It includes the [Fenton 2013 growth charts](https://www.ucalgary.ca/resource/preterm-growth-chart/preterm-growth-chart) for preterm babies.

And, when you input a preterm due date in a child's profile, the app will activate corrected age tracking by default, giving you more useful results and percentiles when using the other growth charts.
